Background Info
- Flickr High Quality Dataset used: 


Set Up:
- note that the preprocessed images and labels are not loaded into the github model yet

To Begin Labelling:
- run the FaceLabeling.py file with "python FaceLabeling.py"
  -> please note that this will look for a file called "labels.csv" to store the labels; you will need to create this file separately on
     your local device
  -> cropped pictures will be stored in the "cropped_pics" folder, which you will also need to create yourself
  -> within the FaceLabeling.py file, there is a loop which considers a range. This range corresponds to the images being processed.
     Please do not set this range to large (~50 per time) to ensure enough error checking.
